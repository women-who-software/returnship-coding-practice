# returnship-coding-practice
Practicing code/design for problems.

### About:

Women Who Code Boulder/Denver's Career Returnship is an initiative to create and support people who are trying to return to tech workforce after taking a career break run by @Rafna. This space is to practice technical coding interviews.

### The format is simple:

We discuss a problem in the meetup and try to solve it in 30 minutes. If we were able to find a solution, then everyone will try to write the code in their system in any programming language. 

To submit a solution, create a branch with your name and put your solution in that branch. All languages are welcome! Please title your solution the same as the problem.
Add your solution to the codingsolutions/ [name of coding challenge] folder.
Once you add your solution, create a pull request and we will add your code to our repo.
