Example: 1    2    3    4         a b c d
	       5    6    7    8         e f g h
   	     9   10   11  12          i j k l
	       13  14   15  16          m n o p

Output:    1    2    3   4        a b c d
	         12   13   14  5        l m n e
	         11   16   15  6        k p o f
	         10   9    8   7        j i h g
