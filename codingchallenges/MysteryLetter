Your mission is to send an encoded message to MI6. The message should contain a key number to decipher the message and contain only strings . 
Convert each word of message into a palindrome string followed by the key number. 
Rules of encoding:
1. Reduce the value of a letter only by 1 ( previous letter in the alphabet), i.e. change "d" to "c", but cannot change "c" to "d" or "d" to "b".
2. The letter "a" may not be reduced any further, i.e. "a" stays as "a".

Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. 
Assume all strings are composed of lower case English letters, ascii[a-z], with spaces.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome and add the number as the last character of the new encoded string.

Eg 1. For input string = "cde", the following two operations are performed: 
- cde → cdd → cdc with an operation count of 2.
Final encoding is : "cdc2"

Eg 2. For input string = “send a special agent” 
- Send -> senc -> senb -> ....
- Agent -> agens -> agenq -> ....
- Special -> rpecial -> qpecial -> ppecial -> opecial -> .... 
Final encoding : "sees4 a speceps6 agega5"

Advanced challenge: Decipher the message sent to MI6 using the key number.
