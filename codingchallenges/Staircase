Build a staircase with coins:

You have a total of 'n' coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins. That is, 1st row must have 1 coin, 2nd row must have 2 coins...
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

For example, Input: 5 coins
Output: 2 rows

1st row-> *   //full row
2nd row-> **  //full row
3rd row-> **  //not a full row, need one more coin to be a full row
