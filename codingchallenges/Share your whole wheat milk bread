Share your whole wheat milk bread: 
You have a whole wheat milk bread of size L*B. Your task is to cut this bread into smaller identical pieces with no left over piece of bread. 
We share this bread equally with everyone joining us today and future events. How to cut?!

Each piece will be a square having maximum possible side length with no left over piece of bread. 
How many pieces you got and what was the size of the piece of bread? 

Example: if bread is the size of 6*9, we can cut into 54 sqaures of 1*1, 6 squares of 3*3. Hence the output will be 6 pieces of size 3.
